# TrashStasherGame
Game Design Solo Project

Arcade style single player game

Premise: A raccoon in a dangerous city must gather and hoard trash while viscious dogs roam the alleyways.

Controls:
Move: WASD
Deposit Trash: Space
Use Powerup: K

How to play:
Gather trash by moving onto its space. Trash collected will be displayed at the top of the screen along with 
a point value and a weight value. Deposit all held trash by standing next to a trash can and depositing it.
The more trash you hold, the more points you well get via a multipier per trash deposited. However, the 
weight of all the trash will slow you down, leaving you vulnerable to attack dogs.

Avoid dogs line of sight. If seen by a dog they will give chase at a higher speed and use pathfinding to 
determining the best path to catch you. Stay out of sight long enough and they will give up and return
to wandering the map. The longer the round goes on, the more dogs appear.

Use powerups to avoid the dogs. Powerups include
Dig: Facing a wall with an empty space on the opposite side, use to dig under the wall to escape dead ends
Speed Up: Increases speed of your raccoon for a faster getaway
Pause: Freezes all dogs in place for a few seconds
